About Me:
I was shown the world of IT at a young age due to my dad being an IT consultant, which helped show me that a career in IT is what I want 
to do with my life. I started my course in 2016, originally taking the Genetics elective group due to it interesting me; it also allowed 
me to take Artificial Intelligence in third year, which few elective groups allow. Now, in third year, I got the choice to take more 
Computer Science related modules instead of the Genetics electives, and I opted for that instead. In my spare time I enjoy series or 
going out and meeting new people. I like to think I’m a very sociable person and look forward to working with many different people in 
the years to come, as I firmly believe you can learn a lot from anybody that you meet.
