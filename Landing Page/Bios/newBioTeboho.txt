I started BSc IT (Knowledge and Information Systems) in 2015, I am currently doing my final year at the University of Pretoria. I have been a member of World CodeSprint 12 (local and global coding competition) since the year 2016. My enthusiasm for programming and Computer Science remains undiminished after facing many challenges, including a cancer diagnosis (which I underwent treatment for and have been cured from) and the death of two immediate-family members - to mention a few. I have a determination to finish what I start and a hunger to do more. I have this relentless passion for programming and software engineering allows me to maximise my potential.
