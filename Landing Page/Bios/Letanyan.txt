About Me:
I am currently a 3rd-year student at the University of Pretoria studying BSc. Computer Science. In my spare time, I'm an active member of the Swift-Evolution community, which deals with the language design of, the programming language, Swift. With Swift, I have created applications that have were published on the Apple App Store. Building these apps allows me to do a few things that I enjoy. These would be algorithm optimisation, user experience and designing an excellent looking user interface.
