Bio: Since the beginning of my degree I have been looking forward to doing 
Software Engineering. I wanted to combine different systems, mix the old 
and the new and especially combine mathematics and Information 
Technology. Mathematics has been the one subject that has been getting 
the best of students since the beginning and IT is the new world that 
everyone wants to be part of. I chose to do both to truly defeat something 
that has challenged to students and join the world of IT where concepts 
and theories were made possible. I want to work with different people, 
create things that were just thoughts and improve life as a whole. IT gives 
me that opportunity.
