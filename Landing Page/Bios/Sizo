Bio :
  I started at the University of Pretoria in 2015 studying Computer Science. In
  second year I decided to switch to the BSc Information Technology program which allowed 
  me to take Computer Science along with Informatics as a second major. I did
  this because while I am highly passionate about the deeper back-end development that
  Computer Science targets, I also love business. I particularly like the business aspect
  of IT with front-end development, and wish to attain as much knowledge as I can
  about: systems development, front-end development, and back-end development which
  are all catered for best in BSc Information Technology (Software Development). I am
  passionate about what I am studying which makes putting in the extra effort to always
  produce a perfect product that much easier.
