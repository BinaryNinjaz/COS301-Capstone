**About Me:**<br> Since the beginning of my degree I have been looking forward to doing Software Engineering. I wanted to combine different systems, mix the old and the new and especially combine mathematics and Information Technology. Mathematics has been the one subject that has been getting the best of students since the beginning and IT is the new world that everyone wants to be part of. I chose to do both to truly defeat something that has challenged to students and join the world of IT where concepts and theories were made possible. I want to work with different people,create things that were just thoughts and improve life as a whole. IT gives me that opportunity.

**About Me:**<br>
 	I came out of high school and went into computer engineering for a year and a half, after only enjoying the computer science modules, I decided it was time to make a change. Since that change, I have grown to love almost all things computer science, and have never been happier.In my spare time I tend to enjoy video games, series and movies. But otherwise, I take great pleasure in programming--nothing better than a good challenge--or other computer related things; like when you have over 60 mods (it&#39;s not many I know) in skyrim and it all works--then you realise that that&#39;s actually the best part of the game; or learning Dvorak was great fun; blender&#39;s my on and off again lover; installing and configuring an operating system is always a hoot--speaking of: it&#39;s time I installed Arch again. . .
