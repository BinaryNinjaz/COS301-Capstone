The Bootstrap and JQuery libraries have been added here, locally. They're not currently on the master branch, but will be there with the next merge.
If they are really needed ASAP, then make a pull reguest.

**Remember to use the CDNs at deployment. And if you are connected to the internet, it is most probably better to be using them over the locals when testing.**
