Meeting 9 (18-07-18)
Any problems? How far is each and every person.
Congratulate everyone for passing and working hard for the past couple of days (keep it up, that’s all I ever want to see).
Book meeting with Stacy.
Any questions for our client?
Field test for two hours (load app on to everyone’s phones, Kevin is Farmer on web, switch phones to poor signal, monitor data, battery life and temperature of the phone).
