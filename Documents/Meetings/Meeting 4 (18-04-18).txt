Go to Zube in meeting.
Rotations and scrolling bugs.
Password minimum length, ask Client.
Architecture we are using, get back to each other on Monday.
Something about GitHub structure and commit bit by bit, always go through developer, git ignore libraries.
Look at domain model, remove GPSTracker class, look into using database class.
Design of apps switching around plus or minus on android, change background colour and try to make button height shorter, logo, colours, plain background for mobile login look into that.
Communication, post design pictures continuously.
Start using code freezes (Thursday noon).
Explain firebase set up.
New roles:
Kevin – Android (mostly back-end), handle all android testing.
Vince – Website (mostly front-end), prototypes for mobile settings, administration and privileges, try to get iOS emulator working on your laptop
Shaun – Android and website (back-end in android and back-end in web), make logout on android, administration and privileges
Sizo – Website (full stack, head of web), make web homepage functional, administration and privileges
Letanyan – iOS (full stack), QA lead and head of iOS finish app
John – Android (full stack), head of android, catch up to iOS.
No half jobs, if you are going to do something you do it all (design, logic, database) it must work like how it will work in its target market.
We can’t leave Letanyan alone on iOS so we will have to really find out how the iOS emulators are.
Ask for permission before messing around with another guys code/file.
Go to web to explain admin.
