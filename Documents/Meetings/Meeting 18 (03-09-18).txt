Meeting 18 (03-09-18)
Shaun start pushing all platform branches to master and rebase.
What are your suggestions for the wow factor (each person give a suggestion)? Voice search is for project day we need something for demo 5. Something with weather, we can tell many things from it.
Only documentation this week (User manual is a priority). User manual –  Letanyan and John, Landing page – Shaun and Letanyan, Coding Standards – Sizo and Kevin, Finances – John and Sizo, Testing Policy – Vince and Kevin, Requirements Document – Vince and Shaun. All this done by Friday 07 September. I’ve already assigned people on Zenhub, move it to appropriate column on Zenhub when you are done.
Explain how email verification works, why is it important?
One automated test from each person per week, it could be something you implemented already, but not too old.
iOS is in review and is going to be deployed on Letanyan’s App store account.
When should we book for on 21 September (demo 5)?
Anything from you guys?
