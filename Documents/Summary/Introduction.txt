We are the Binary Ninjaz, with Letanyan as QA Lead, Sizo as Front-end Architect, Kevin as Back-end Architect, Shaun as UX designer, Teboho as UI designer and I, John, as Team Leader, Scrum master and Analyst. At the end of the day any gun can shoot, in other words a basic system can be developed, but as a team we aim to hit the target and have a system that is beneficial to the intended users.
