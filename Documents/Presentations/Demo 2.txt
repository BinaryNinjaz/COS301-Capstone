Brief description:	
Our project, Harvest, is an application to assist growers with yield data and optimise worker performance. In other words, our project is a system that can efficiently measure the amount of work done by a worker, track the foremen on a farm, record information and data, and display the necessary information. This system is aimed at farming communities to help then record data and get work done more efficiently.
